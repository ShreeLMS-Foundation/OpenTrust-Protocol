🧭 OpenTrust Principles
1. Human First

Systems must adapt to humans — not the other way around.

2. Minimum Data

Collect only what is required to build trust.

3. Consent & Clarity

Users must know what data is used and why.

4. Local Authority

Trust can be community-based, not centralized.

5. Transparency

Rules must be readable and understandable.

6. Interoperability

Anyone can build on OpenTrust.

7. Non-Extraction

No forced monetization of trust data.
