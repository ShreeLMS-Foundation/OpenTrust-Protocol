🌍 Vision

To build a world where digital trust is earned, not extracted.

Where people:

Understand who they interact with

Control their own data

Are protected from abuse

Can participate without fear

🌱 Core Beliefs

Trust is social, not algorithmic

Identity ≠ Surveillance

Technology must serve humans

Transparency builds safety

Local context matters

🌐 Long-Term Vision

A future where:

Every digital interaction has accountability

Communities define their own trust rules

Technology supports humans, not replaces them
