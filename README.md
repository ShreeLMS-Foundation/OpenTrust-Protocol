🧭 What is OpenTrust Protocol?

OpenTrust Protocol (OTP) is an open, human-first framework designed to establish trust, accountability, and safety in digital interactions — without surveillance, exploitation, or centralized control.

It is not a company, not a product, and not a platform.

It is a standard — a shared way for people, communities, and systems to interact responsibly online.

🌱 Why OpenTrust Exists

The internet today suffers from:

Fake identities

Scams and misinformation

Zero accountability

Over-centralized platforms

Exploitation of user data

OpenTrust exists to solve trust, not scale.

🎯 Core Goal

To create a universal trust layer that allows humans to interact digitally with:

clarity

accountability

dignity

🔑 What OpenTrust Is NOT

❌ Not a cryptocurrency

❌ Not a surveillance system

❌ Not a social media platform

❌ Not a company

It is a set of principles, structures, and reference implementations.

🧩 Who Is It For?

Local communities

Independent developers

Ethical startups

NGOs

Digital citizens

Governments seeking trust frameworks
